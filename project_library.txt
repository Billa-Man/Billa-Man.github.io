developing modular Flask endpoints with extensive error handling and logging.
**Created AI conversation ﬂows** using Retell SDK that captured customer information for 
policy modiﬁcations **with [X]% successful data extraction rate** and **automated transfer to 
human agents** for complex cases requiring **personalized assistance**, by designing state-
based conversation logic with fallback mechanisms.
**Built post-call analysis system** that generated completion summaries and automated email 
notiﬁcations **for [X]% of successfully processed calls**, **reducing administrative overhead by 
[Y]%** through webhook integration, by implementing structured call data collection and email 
automation services.
**Developed robust logging infrastructure** using Loguru that captured **detailed call ﬂow 
data** across **multiple endpoints** with **real-time debugging capabilities**, **improving 
system troubleshooting eﬃciency by [X]%**, by implementing comprehensive request/
response logging and error tracking.
**Implemented security-ﬁrst authentication** using Google Service Account credentials and 
Retell API key management **with 100% request veriﬁcation** for all customer data operations, 
**preventing [X] potential security incidents**, by establishing secure API communication 
patterns and input validation protocols.
**Designed scalable webhook endpoints** that handled **insurance policy modiﬁcations** for 
driver information, vehicle details, address changes, coverage adjustments, and ID card 
--- Page 16 ---
requests **with [X]% uptime** and **automated queue retry logic** for failed connections, by 
creating modular, maintainable Flask applications with comprehensive error handling.
**Integrated voice synthesis technology** using ElevenLabs models **to provide natural-
sounding AI responses** during customer conversations, **improving user experience scores 
by [X]%** through enhanced voice quality, by conﬁguring voice model parameters and 
response formatting.
**Built data collection framework** that systematically captured **customer information** across 
multiple insurance operation types **with structured validation** for names, dates, license 
numbers, and policy details, **achieving [X]% data accuracy**, by implementing 
comprehensive input validation and type checking.
**Developed call status monitoring system** that tracked **call lifecycle events** and provided 
**real-time status updates** to stakeholders, **enabling proactive issue resolution** for 
**blocked customer requests**, by implementing webhook endpoints for call status tracking 
and automated alerting.
**Created modular state management** for diﬀerent insurance operations **with separate 
logging sheets** for driver changes, vehicle modiﬁcations, address updates, and coverage 
adjustments, **organizing [X] diﬀerent request types** into structured workﬂows, by designing 
state-based processing logic with appropriate data validation for each operation type.
These bullet points focus on the technical achievements, business impact, and measurable 
outcomes from this comprehensive insurance automation system. The project demonstrates 
strong skills in full-stack development, API integration, AI/voice technologies, data 
management, and scalable system design. 
 
8. Company Info Extractor (Internship) 
Based on my analysis of this repository, here are comprehensive resume points using Google's 
XYZ methodology (Accomplished X, measured by Y , by doing Z). I've focused on the technical 
achievements, system architecture, and business impact while using placeholders for metrics 
and avoiding any fabrication of data.
## **Technical Architecture & System Design**
**Designed and implemented a multi-agent AI system for business intelligence gathering**, 
consisting of 4 specialized agents with distinct responsibilities, by developing a modular 
architecture using OpenAI's Agents SDK that enabled parallel processing of company research 
tasks.
**Built an intelligent web scraping and research pipeline**, capable of extracting detailed 
company information across multiple data sources, by implementing custom web scraping 
logic with BeautifulSoup that identiﬁed key personnel information including contact details, 
roles, and professional backgrounds.
**Developed a comprehensive data management system**, integrating Google Sheets API for 
persistent storage, by creating a custom GoogleSheetsManager class that handled data 
validation, duplicate prevention, and structured data organization across 10 data columns.
